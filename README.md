### Try it!

Try a demo of the Purpose Platform and a [movement site](https://github.com/PurposeOpen/Movement) running on it here:

Platform:  
[https://platform-dev-demo.herokuapp.com](https://platform-dev-demo.herokuapp.com)  
login: `admin@example.com`  
password: `developers3x`

Movement:  
[https://movement-dev-demo.herokuapp.com](http://movement-dev-demo.herokuapp.com)

The movement site is running a [movement site template](https://github.com/PurposeOpen/Movement) that you can use and customize however you like!

These apps may need a minute to warm up on your first request because they are running on Heroku's free tier.
